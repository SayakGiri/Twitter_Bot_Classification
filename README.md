### Data: To be scraped from twitter based on topics trending.
We have (for now) decided to use trending topics using hashtags as the likelihood of bots being employed is higher. In case of political viewpoints, we will take opposing views together to assess if either of the trend is more likely to be artificially elevated.
Also, there are few datasets available for this from some known organsation for initial building and testing of models. We are hoping to use Twitter API to collect data for relevant case.
Have requested access for the same for academic purpose.



### Software: Python
### Statistical Techniques

### Methodology
#### Running regression model on CRESCI data to understand how to fit a model to the data. Struggling with features currently.
